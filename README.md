In the paper we derive the equations for the bifurcation sets of the mean-field Ising model for both the standard
-1/1 and the 0/1 version of the Ising model. These are used to clarify the role of connectivity,
particularly in the 0/1 model, where nodes represent clinical symptoms that are absent or present,
as applied to the modeling of psychopathology. We show that, consistent with the findings in the
clinical literature, increased connectivity increases the risk of transitioning to an unhealthy state,
such as depression.
